What would've caused these buildings to fall to ruin? $(br)$(br) The only theory I have for this is that of the main building's architecture being made into bricks from the stone below, however, these ones are charred to hell and back. $(br)$(br) Perhaps a type of heatwave occured to practically melt the structure, I wonder what it would've looked like back in it's golden days."
