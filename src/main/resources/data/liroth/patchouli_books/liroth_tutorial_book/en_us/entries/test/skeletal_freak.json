The Skeletal Freak is what's left of the corpse's when they haven't any food left. They eat themselves until they have nothing left and then the arms, once the arms have been eaten they only have the central eye, which seems to also be their brain."

However their skeletal frame seems weak, as if I can bend it easily, although, it's hard to snap, they are extremely malleable, perhaps I could make some kind of weapons from their bones? I will look into this in a later entry, for now I need research these creatures."

Yet, the bones still appear... alive. Either I have been going a little more insane than I wish to admit, I believe I have seen their bones pulsate."
