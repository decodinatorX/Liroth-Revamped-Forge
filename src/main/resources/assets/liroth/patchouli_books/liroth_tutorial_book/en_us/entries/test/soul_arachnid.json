I have watched this creature prowl around and absorb the cool air of the Spiced Desert, keeping it's distance from the trees as it does this. The Arachnid bears its name because I feel that if I were to perish before it, it would simply absorb my soul as the mist is has before me. $(br)$(br) So evidentatly, their diet is the cool air and possibly souls."

However, sticking to Spiced Trees makes them keep their distance, and I have discovered the reason as well, for the air surrounds the trees is quite painful to the nostrils and lungs, spicy air basically, and to these creatures, it'd be like getting a spice in your eyes. Which in their defense would sound painful."
