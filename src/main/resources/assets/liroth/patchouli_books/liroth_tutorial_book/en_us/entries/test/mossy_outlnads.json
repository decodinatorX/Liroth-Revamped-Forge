The overgrowth of vines, moss, and more have just absolutely taken over this possibly beautiful landscape and in my own opinion has made it just that more aesthetic. $(br)$(br) The moss is surely not harvestable, it tears away as I try to pick at it almost immediately. The trees here are the same as the meadow and are actually emmiting a pleasant smell of a mix between lavender and raspberry."
